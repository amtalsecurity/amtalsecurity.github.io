                    <p class="text-muted">Identifying your threat exposure is a critical process in your risk assessment. Vulnerability management and pentests are two preventive controls that would help you in this identification process.<br/>We don't simply throw off Qualys report on your desk; discovered vulnerabilities needs to be scored in a way that would ease the integration of test results in your risk assessment framework. Consequently, leveraging the capacity to bring accurate metrics in your risk analysis and help you to determine the most critical controls that needs to be prioritised for implemention.<br/><br/>

                    <p class="text-muted">Maximization of these valuable log traces to create dashboards, identify clipping levels and spot attackers is a complex task. And it doesn't stop there; once identified, you need to react in a prompt and efficient manner. Via Security Monitoring and Incident Response practice, we aim to bring together this efficiency by taking the best value from your already implemented controls.
