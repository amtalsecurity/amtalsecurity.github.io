                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">The "Amtal Rule" was a tradition practiced on primitive planets; this concept literally translates as "tested to destruction". It is a concept which core's axiom states that in order to safely rely on a system, one had to know its limits. Only when the target of evaluation would be pushed beyond its limits, its true nature be seen. For societies living in tough environments, the "Amtal Rule" was the only logical test to guarantee robustness of systems upon which people's life would depend. <i>(Dune novel series)</i></h3>
