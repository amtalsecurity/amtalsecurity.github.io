description: "<div style='text-align:left'>Once controls are in place, you need to maximize their potential and value their investment. It is often challenging to aggregate and correlate the output of disparate controls. Therefore, you often end up with expensive security solution from which you cannot get valuable or exploitable information. Most common issue you have to cope with are, just to name a few, IDS popping thousands of false positives a day, cryptic vulnerability scan reports, overloaded log entry flowing through your SIEM,... And when real problem arises, it is always difficult to find the needle in the haystack. But finding this needle is critical to be able to react appropriately to this incident.</div><p/>
<div style='text-align:left'>We can help you to value this information. All these log sources could be exploited in correlation rules and support you in detecting fraud or intrusion.
