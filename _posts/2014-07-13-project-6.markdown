ISO27001 is the de facto standard for most organization who wants to implement a state of the art ISMS. Developping this ISMS brings a new light to the different processes and controls in place in your organisation. It is a fantastic tool to identify the weaknesses in your controls and to be able to prioritize them. Unfortunately, this might exhaust your internal resources and distract you from the daily task and core business.</div>
