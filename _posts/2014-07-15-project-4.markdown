description: "<div style='text-align:left'>Open source is often perceived as a scary monster for geeks. But let's face it, most of the best breed security solutions heavily rely on open source products customized with fancy interfaces with poor outsourced support. On top of this, many open sources products are heavily deployed in huge infrastructures and are therefore de facto supported by a huge and dynamic community always up to the latest threats.</div><p/>
<div style='text-align:left'>
